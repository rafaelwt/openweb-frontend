confirmation modal component with two-button layout (Cancel/Confirm).\nDisplays a blocking modal dialog asking the user to confirm or cancel an operation.\nThe modal state and configuration are managed by ConfirmationModalService.\nFeatures:\n\nPromise-based API for async user decisions\nTwo-button layout (Cancel + Confirm)\nOptional details section for key-value pairs\nResponsive design (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)\nMatches ErrorModal visual design (backdrop blur, animations, Tailwind styling)\nOnPush change detection for optimal performance\n\nUsage:\nComponent is registered globally in MainLayoutComponent and controlled via service.\nExample :// In your component:\nprivate readonly confirmModal = inject(ConfirmationModalService);\n\n\nasync deleteItem() {\n  const confirmed = await this.confirmModal.confirm({\n    title: 'Eliminar item',\n    message: '¿Está seguro?',\n    confirmText: 'Eliminar',\n    cancelText: 'Cancelar'\n  });\n\n\n  if (confirmed)

component with two-button layout (Cancel/Confirm).\n *\n * Displays a blocking modal dialog asking the user to confirm or cancel an operation.\n * The modal state and configuration are managed by {@link ConfirmationModalService}.\n *\n * @remarks\n * **Features:**\n * - Promise-based API for async user decisions\n * - Two-button layout (Cancel + Confirm)\n * - Optional details section for key-value pairs\n * - Responsive design (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)\n * - Matches ErrorModal visual design (backdrop blur, animations, Tailwind styling)\n * - OnPush change detection for optimal performance\n *\n * **Usage:**\n * Component is registered globally in MainLayoutComponent and controlled via service.\n *\n * @example\n * ```typescript\n * // In your component:\n * private readonly confirmModal = inject(ConfirmationModalService);\n *\n * async deleteItem() {\n *   const confirmed = await this.confirmModal.confirm({\n *     title: 'Eliminar item',\n *     message: '¿Está seguro?',\n *     confirmText: 'Eliminar',\n *     cancelText: 'Cancelar'\n *   });\n *\n *   if (confirmed) {\n *     // Proceed with deletion\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @selector

Returns true if user confirms, false if user cancels.\n\nUses reactive signals for modal visibility and configuration\nPromise-based confirm() method allows clean async/await syntax\nDefault styling uses warning/amber theme\nSupports optional key-value details display\n\nExample :const confirmed = await this.confirmModal.confirm({\n  title: 'Eliminar item',\n  message: '¿Desea eliminar este elemento del carrito?',\n  confirmText: 'Eliminar',\n  cancelText: 'Cancelar'\n});\n\n\nif (confirmed) {\n  // User clicked confirm - proceed with action\n} else {\n  // User clicked cancel - abort

generation.\n\n## Contents\n\n- **Templates** (\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:
